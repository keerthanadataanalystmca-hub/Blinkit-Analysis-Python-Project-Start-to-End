‚ö° Blinkit Sales Performance Data Analysis Mini-Project
This repository contains a Data Analysis mini-project focused on examining the sales performance, inventory distribution, and customer satisfaction metrics for the quick commerce platform Blinkit.

The goal is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to derive key business insights. The analysis identifies top-performing categories, assesses the influence of store characteristics (like location and size) on sales, and provides actionable recommendations to optimize operations and improve overall revenue.

‚ú® Key Features & Business Insights
The analysis addresses key business questions and delivers insights across several dimensions, as outlined in the provided business requirements (BRD):

1. Core Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Sales: Overall revenue generated.

Average Sales: The average revenue per item sale.

Number of Items: The total count of distinct products sold.

Average Rating: A measure of overall customer satisfaction.

2. Strategic Visual Analysis
The project utilizes various visualizations to understand key drivers of sales:

Area of Analysis	Objective	Key Visualizations
Product Performance	Analyze the impact of product attributes on sales.	Total Sales by Item Type (Bar Chart), Sales by Fat Content (Donut Chart).
Store Characteristics	Evaluate how outlet features influence revenue.	Sales by Outlet Size (Donut/Pie Chart).
Geographic Impact	Assess the geographic distribution and performance of outlets.	Sales by Outlet Location (Funnel/Map Chart).
Trend Analysis	Evaluate how the age or type of outlet establishment influences total sales.	Total Sales by Outlet Establishment (Line Chart).
Comparative Performance	Compare total sales across different outlets, segmented by product features like fat content.	Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales (Stacked Column Chart).
